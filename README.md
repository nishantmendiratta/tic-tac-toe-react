# tic-tac-toe-react
Going to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game.

###Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

>npm start
Starts the development server.

>npm run build
Bundles the app into static files for production.

>npm test
Starts the test runner.

>npm run eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

###We suggest that you begin by typing:

	> create-react-app tic-tac-toe
	> npm install
	> npm start

####Getting Started
Start with this example: Starter Code.

It contains the shell of what we're building today. You only need to worry about the JavaScript.

In particular, we have three components:
 - Square
 - Board
 - Game

The Square component renders a single `` <div> ``, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with some placeholders that we'll fill in later. None of the components are interactive at this point.

(The end of the JS file also defines a helper function `` calculateWinner `` that we'll use later.)
